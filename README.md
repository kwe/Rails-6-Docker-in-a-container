# Rails in a container for development

Based on this [great write up](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/painless-rails-development-environment-setup-with-docker/). Just slightly modified the Dockerfile to install Yarn, which Rails 6 needs. A neat way to get a Rails dev setup without installing lots of stuff on your local machine.
